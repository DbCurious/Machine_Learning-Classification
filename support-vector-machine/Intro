Support Vector Machine
   1.A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model objective with the to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features)
     that distinctly classifies the data points.
   2.To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. 
     Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes.  
   3.Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes.
