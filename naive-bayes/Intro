Naive Bayes Algorithm

    It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.
    A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task.
    It is easy and fast to predict class of test data set. It also perform well in multi class prediction
    Types of Naive Bayes Classifier:
      Multinomial Naive Bayes
      Bernoulli Naive Bayes
      Gaussian Naive Bayes:
