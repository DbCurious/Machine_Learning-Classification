    a.A decision tree is a supervised machine learning model used to predict a target by learning decision rules from features. 
    b.As the name suggests, we can think of this model as breaking down our data by making a decision based on asking a series of questions.
    c.Decision-tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning algorithms. It works for both continuous as well as categorical output variables.
    d.The branches/edges represent the result of the node and the nodes have either:  
       a.Conditions [Decision Nodes]
       b.Result [End Nodes]
  
    e.Decision tree observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output. 
    f.Continuous output means that the output/result is not discrete, i.e., it is not represented just by a discrete, known set of numbers or values.
    g.Using the decision algorithm, we start at the tree root and split the data on the feature that results in the largest information gain (IG) 
      (reduction in uncertainty towards the final decision).
