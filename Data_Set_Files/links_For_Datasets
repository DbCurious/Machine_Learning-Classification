    The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community
for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.
    Many people deserve thanks for making the repository a success. Foremost among them are the donors and creators of the databases and data generators. 
Special thanks should also go to the past librarians of the repository: David Aha, Patrick Murphy, Christopher Merz, Eamonn Keogh, Cathy Blake, Seth Hettich, and David Newman
