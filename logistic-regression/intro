1.Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary.
2.Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
3.Logistic Regression models are classification models; specifically binary classification models (they can only be used to distinguish between 2 different categories 
4.In Logistic Regression, we don’t directly fit a straight line to our data like in linear regression. Instead, we fit a S shaped curve, called Sigmoid
5.The logistic function is defined as:
                                    transformed = 1 / (1 + e^-x)
              Where e is the numerical constant Euler’s number and x is a input we plug into the function.
