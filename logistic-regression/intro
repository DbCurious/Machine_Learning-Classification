1.Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is binary.
2.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
3.The logistic function is defined as:
                                    transformed = 1 / (1 + e^-x)
              Where e is the numerical constant Eulerâ€™s number and x is a input we plug into the function.
